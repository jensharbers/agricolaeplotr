Description: Visualization of Design of Experiments from the \code{agricolae} package with \code{ggplot2} framework
    The user provides an outdesign from the \code{agricolae} packages, calls the corresponding function and will receive a 
    visualization with \code{ggplot2} based functions that are specific for each design. As there are many different designs, each design is tested on its type.
    The output can be modified with standard \code{ggplot2} commands or with other packages with \code{ggplot2} function extensions.
